# Rock_Paper_Scissors
The object of the stone paper-scissor python project is to build a game for a solo player that plays with a PC, anyplace, and whenever. This venture is base on the principles that:

1. Rock dulls Scissors so Rock wins
2. Scissors cut the Paper so Scissors win
3. Paper cover Rock so Paper wins
This venture is assemble utilizing tkinter, irregular modules, and the essential idea of python.

In this python project, players need to pick any one from rock, paper, and scissors. Then, at that point, click on the play button will show the consequence of the game.

# Project Requirement
To implement this python rock paper scissors project we will use the basic concept of python with tkinter and random module.

**Tkinter()** is a standard GUI library which is one of the easiest ways to build a GUI application.

**random** module use to generate random numbers

To install the libraries we can use the pip installer command on the command prompt:
   
    $pip install Tk
   
    $pip install Tkintertable
   
    $pip install random2


# Project file structure
These are the step to build a rock-paper-scissors game using python:

1. Import required libraries
2. Initialize window
3. Code for user choice
4. Code for computer choice
5. Define functions
6. Define buttons
